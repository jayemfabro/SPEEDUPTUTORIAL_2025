 * Simple test for teacher statistics display

echo "============= Teacher Statistics Display Fix =============\n\n";

echo "Issue identified: Statistics not displaying in the TeacherOverview component\n\n";

echo "Changes made:\n";
echo "1. Updated getTeacherDashboardStats() in User.php:\n";
echo "   - Added explicit type casting to ensure values are integers\n";
echo "   - Added comprehensive error handling\n";
echo "   - Enhanced logging for better debugging\n";
echo "   - Ensured consistent return value structure\n\n";

echo "2. Updated TeacherOverview.jsx:\n";
echo "   - Added detailed console logging of API responses\n";
echo "   - Added fallback display values (N/A) when data is missing\n";
echo "   - Added state logging to track changes\n";
echo "   - Improved data handling with explicit value extraction\n\n";

echo "Expected behavior after fixes:\n";
echo "- All four statistics cards should show numerical values\n";
echo "- Values should be derived from the teacher's classes in the database\n";
echo "- If a value is truly zero (e.g., no absences), it will show 0\n";
echo "- If there's an error retrieving the value, it will show N/A\n\n";

echo "Verification steps:\n";
echo "1. Refresh the TeacherOverview page\n";
echo "2. Check browser console for detailed logging\n";
echo "3. Verify all four statistics cards show values\n";
echo "4. Switch between different teachers to verify values change appropriately\n\n";

echo "Additional debugging tip:\n";
echo "You can check Laravel logs (storage/logs/laravel.log) for detailed API response data\n";
echo "including the exact values being calculated and returned\n\n";
